# Pursuit Hunter Night Drive

## To Do

- use solipsistic origin point
- spline render for roadway and fences
- lighting model, average lights plus passing spotlight (use light-field approach with 2D texture?)
- traffic
- onramp/offramp
- track remote objects set
- semi-irregular horizon twinkly lights (do major road outlines and random inbetween)
- overpasses and underpasses
